# Cloud Performance Benchmark

During the final year of my Computer Science degree, I developed this system / tool and associated scripts to permit the collection and analysis of performance measurements from cloud infrastructure.

There are also scripts which take spot price information, and format it in a way that HTC-Sim can read and create events from.
